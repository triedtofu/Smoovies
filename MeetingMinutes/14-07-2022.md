| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Agenda| Sprint 2 Discussion |
| 2 | Sprint 2 |- Went over inputting data in database, need to add a runtime to each movie, frontend only needs the watch query of trailers url from youtube <br/> - Discussed backend table structure, need to set up 3+ way relationships between tables or manually create tables with all info, to be discussed after experimentation. <br/> - Database is being filled with too much data (especially from actors), decision has been made to only include top 3 actors for the script inserted movies, functionality still remains the same as admins can still add as many actors as they want in real implementation <br/> - Token checking for addMovie/review is broken |
| 3 | Agenda for next meeting | - Check up on progress in second sprint <br/>|
